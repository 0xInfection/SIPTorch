# SIPTorch
A (WIP) "SIP Torture" ([RFC 4475](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4475)) testing suite.

Presently under development, but still usable, just:
- Open `core/config.py`, and edit your environment variables in, or you can use the defaults in there. 
- Then just run `python3 siptorch.py`.
- You should find a directory called `siptorch-output/` in your current working directory holding the results.

Release to be announced soon, once the work gets over. :)
